# Dezai — Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Sprint 8] — 2026-07-11

### Enterprise Assessments & Compliance (Manan Panchal)

#### Added
- **Enterprise Question Banks** — CRUD endpoints and backend service supporting manual/AI-generated banks with organization and department scoping.
- **Compliance Assessments** — Assessment CRUD requiring a minimum of 10 questions in the referenced question bank, and a dynamic shuffled question select query implementing Fisher-Yates shuffle and cache-aside (via Redis/in-memory cache).
- **Compliance Attempts** — Start attempt constraints, resume, autosave, and grading workflow. Grade evaluation stores BOTH raw score and percentage at submit time.
- **Compliance Dashboards** — Performance aggregation dashboards for organizations, departments, employees, and specific tracks.
- **Compliance Demo Tracks Seed** — Seed script containing 4 tracks (Cyber Security, Password Security, Data Privacy, Secure Email) with 25 questions each.
- **Unit Tests** — 3 comprehensive unit test suites covering EnterpriseQuestionBankService, ComplianceAttemptService, and EnterpriseDashboardService.

---

## [Sprint 7] — 2026-06-30

### Assessment Hardening & Production Readiness (Antigravity AI)

#### Added
- **Docker Compose for Redis** — Added local Redis 7 Alpine configuration with AOF persistence.
- **PATCH /api/assessments/attempts/sync** — Batch synchronization endpoint for offline answers.
- **Offline Sync Queue** — React hook integration with connection state monitoring, automatic retry queue (exponential backoff), and `navigator.sendBeacon` fallback.
- **Sync Status Badge** — Dynamic status badge (`Saved`, `Syncing...`, `Offline`, `Sync Error`) in the assessment player interface.
- **Unit Tests** — Added 3 test suites covering Question Selection caching, Sync attempt constraints, and Analytics validation logic.

#### Changed
- **Redis Cache-Aside** — Integrated cache-aside caching for QuestionSelectionService (5-minute TTL) with automatic invalidation hooks on question banks and questions modifications.
- **Tenant Isolation** — Added strict program/faculty validation to cohort weak topic detection and analytics queries to prevent cross-tenant data leaks.
- **Attempt Count Validation Fix** — Corrected `submitSession` attempt count query to filter exclusively by completed attempts (`completedAt !== null`), preventing active attempts from counting towards the maximum limit.

## [Sprint 6.6] — 2026-06-25

### Auth, DB Resilience & Performance Stabilization + Seed Fixes (Ansh Dhanani)

#### Fixed
- **Auth.js ClientFetchError** — Changed `[...nextauth]/route.ts` from `export const { GET, POST } = handlers;` to explicit `export async function GET(request)` wrappers. Next.js 16 serves HTML for catch-all dynamic routes with the destructured export pattern because it passes 2 args (request + params Promise) but NextAuth v5 handlers expect only 1. Explicit wrappers fix `"<!DOCTYPE html>"` errors from `/api/auth/session`.
- **Neon DB Auto-Suspend (P1001)** — Added `connect_timeout=15` to `DATABASE_URL`, removed non-standard `connection_lifetime=300`. Added `retryOnWakeup()` method to `PrismaService` that catches P1001 at query time and retries 2x with 3s delay. Wrapped `authenticateUser`, `getNote`, `upsertNote` with retry.
- **Seed Data Underpopulated Banks** — `qb-genai-leaders` had only 8 questions (from old Sprint 5 seed), `qb-product-design` had only 1 (partial run). The seed's `if (!existingQb)` skip left stale banks untouched. Rewrote to check actual question count vs pool size — existing banks with wrong counts are automatically repopulated with fresh questions. Added stale attempt/session cleanup before bank repopulation to avoid FK constraint violations.

#### Changed
- **Lesson Completion Timing** — Reordered `handleClick` in `mark-complete-button.tsx`: `onComplete?.()` fires first (immediate video transition), toast shows only after API succeeds. `markLessonComplete` changed from `.then()` fire-and-forget to `await` + re-throw so error suppresses toast.
- **Video Player Performance** — Video reads `videoUrl` from `currentLesson` (course data, pre-loaded) instead of waiting for `lessonDetail?.videoUrl`. Added `key={currentLessonId}` to force `<video>` remount on navigation. Content area shows `animate-pulse` skeleton while `lessonDetail` loads.
- **Progress Bar Speed** — Derived from `enrollment.lessonsCompleted.length / allLessons.length` (Zustand local state, optimistically updated) instead of server-provided `enrollment?.progress` which required POST → response → `fetchEnrollments()` chain.

#### Added
- **AGENTS.md** — Documented Next.js 16 + Auth.js patterns for future sessions.

#### Fixed
- **Question Set Mismatch Bug** — `startAttempt` was calling both `createSession` (stores `generateQuestionSet` output as set B) and `selectQuestions` (returns independent set A to the frontend). Both methods independently shuffle and sample from the same bank, producing different question sets. The user answered questions from set A, but the review/result page scored against set B — causing `"Unanswered"` for Q2–Q5 when the IDs didn't overlap. Removed the `selectQuestions` call entirely; `startAttempt` now reads `session.questionSet` directly and formats it for the frontend response. Also removed the unused `QuestionSelectionService` injection from `AttemptService`.

---

## [Sprint 6.5] — 2026-06-24

### Assessment Settings + Progressive Dashboard + Seed Overhaul (Ansh Dhanani)

#### Added
- **Per-Assessment Settings** — `maxAttempts`, `timeLimitEnabled`, `allowResume` fields on Assessment model (Prisma schema + DTOs + service enforcement). Faculty can now configure attempt limits, timed/untimed mode, and resume policy per assessment.
- **Seed Overhaul** — 12 question banks (1 per program, 12 questions each from AI/Business/Design pools) + assessments for ALL 120 modules with varied settings (strict/moderate/relaxed/challenging/practice configs based on module order).
- **Resume Attempt Enhancements** — Pre-take screen shows active session banner with answer count + remaining time; button text changes to "Resume Assessment". Backend returns `maxAttempts`, `timeLimitEnabled`, `allowResume` in attempt responses.
- **Faculty Publish Modal** — New fields: max attempts input, time limit toggle + seconds input, allow resume checkbox.

#### Changed
- **Proctoring Overlay Removed** — Stripped full-screen "Assessment In Progress" overlay + sticky "Exam in progress" banner from student layout. Assessments are online course quizzes, not formal exams.
- **Progressive Dashboard Rendering** — Replaced single `showSkeleton` gate with per-section loading states. Greeting renders instantly, enrollment-dependent sections wait for both stores, independent sections use their own loading states.
- **Empty State Logic** — Empty states only show after BOTH enrollment and program stores confirm no data (fixes race where "No enrollments" flashed before programs loaded).
- **Milestone Service** — Fixed Prisma 6 `NOT: { completedAt: null }` error by removing NOT filter and filtering in JS.

#### Fixed
- `PrismaClientValidationError` in `LearningMilestoneService.getMilestones` — Argument `completedAt` must not be null.
- `getAttemptResult` re-queried `selectQuestions` 3 redundant times (now uses `session.questionSet`).
- CORS — Backend now allows both `http://localhost:3000` and `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

## [Sprint 3] — 2026-06-17

**Developer:** Manan Panchal (Assessment Engine Owner)

### Added

- **Assessment Engine: Question Bank CRUD** — Full create, read, update, delete operations for question banks with institution-scoped ownership validation. Faculty and University Admins can only manage banks belonging to their institution; DEZAI_ADMIN bypasses all checks.
  - Files: [assessment.service.ts](file:///d:/git/dezai/Dezai-Prototype/backend/src/modules/assessments/services/assessment.service.ts), [assessment.controller.ts](file:///d:/git/dezai/Dezai-Prototype/backend/src/modules/assessments/controllers/assessment.controller.ts)
  - Endpoints: `GET/POST /api/assessments/question-banks`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/assessments/question-banks/:id`

- **Assessment Engine: Question Management** — CRUD for individual questions within a bank, supporting MCQ, Single/Multi Correct, and True/False via a flexible `options[]` array. Includes deep-copy duplication with "(Copy)" suffix.
  - Files: [assessment.dto.ts](file:///d:/git/dezai/Dezai-Prototype/backend/src/modules/assessments/dto/assessment.dto.ts), [assessment.service.ts](file:///d:/git/dezai/Dezai-Prototype/backend/src/modules/assessments/services/assessment.service.ts)
  - Endpoints: `POST /api/assessments/question-banks/:bankId/questions`, `PUT/DELETE /api/assessments/questions/:questionId`, `POST /api/assessments/questions/:questionId/duplicate`

- **Assessment Engine: Assessment Builder** — Faculty can create assessments that bind a QuestionBank to a Module with configurable passing score and sample size. Enforces the **100-question gate** — a QuestionBank must have ≥ 100 questions before an assessment can be published against it. This enforces the 100:15 architecture from the Dezai blueprint.
  - Files: [assessment.service.ts](file:///d:/git/dezai/Dezai-Prototype/backend/src/modules/assessments/services/assessment.service.ts)
  - Endpoints: `GET /api/assessments/modules/:moduleId`, `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/assessments/:id`

- **QuestionSelectionService: Fisher-Yates 100:15 Dynamic Question Selection** — Dedicated injectable service implementing randomized question selection. Applies Fisher-Yates shuffle to the full question pool, slices `sampleSize` (default 15) questions, then independently shuffles each question's options. Each API call produces a unique permutation so no two students see the same order. `isCorrect` is intentionally stripped from the response to prevent answer leakage.
  - File: [question-selection.service.ts](file:///d:/git/dezai/Dezai-Prototype/backend/src/modules/assessments/services/question-selection.service.ts)
  - Endpoint: `GET /api/assessments/:id/questions/select`

- **Faculty Analytics Dashboard** — Aggregates completed `AssessmentAttempt` data to compute: total attempts, pass rate (%), average score, highest score, and lowest score per assessment. Only counts completed attempts (`completedAt IS NOT NULL`).
  - File: [assessment.service.ts](file:///d:/git/dezai/Dezai-Prototype/backend/src/modules/assessments/services/assessment.service.ts)
  - Endpoint: `GET /api/assessments/:id/analytics`

- **16 new API endpoints** under `/api/assessments` — All protected by `JwtAuthGuard`; write operations gated by `RolesGuard` with `@Roles(FACULTY, UNIVERSITY_ADMIN, DEZAI_ADMIN)`. Full API contract documented in [docs/API/assessments.md](file:///d:/git/dezai/Dezai-Prototype/docs/API/assessments.md).

- **7 DTOs with class-validator decorators** — `CreateQuestionBankDto`, `UpdateQuestionBankDto`, `CreateQuestionOptionDto`, `CreateQuestionDto`, `UpdateQuestionDto`, `CreateAssessmentDto`, `UpdateAssessmentDto`. All follow `Action + Entity + Dto` naming convention.
  - File: [assessment.dto.ts](file:///d:/git/dezai/Dezai-Prototype/backend/src/modules/assessments/dto/assessment.dto.ts)

- **API Documentation** — Full endpoint contract covering method, route, request body, response shape, auth requirements, and error cases.
  - File: [docs/API/assessments.md](file:///d:/git/dezai/Dezai-Prototype/docs/API/assessments.md)

### Fixed

- **Global ValidationPipe enabled in main.ts** — Added `app.useGlobalPipes(new ValidationPipe({ whitelist: true, transform: true }))` to the NestJS bootstrap. Without this, all `class-validator` decorators (`@IsString()`, `@IsNotEmpty()`, `@Min()`, etc.) were silently ignored and invalid payloads passed through unchecked. This fix applies to **all modules**, not just assessments.
  - File: [main.ts](file:///d:/git/dezai/Dezai-Prototype/backend/src/main.ts)

### Changed

- **AssessmentsModule wired** — Updated the empty scaffold module to import `AuditModule`, register `AssessmentController`, and provide `AssessmentService` + `QuestionSelectionService`.
  - File: [assessments.module.ts](file:///d:/git/dezai/Dezai-Prototype/backend/src/modules/assessments/assessments.module.ts)

- **IMPLEMENTED.md updated** — Added Section 9 documenting Sprint 3 Assessment Engine implementation with full endpoint table.
  - File: [docs/IMPLEMENTED.md](file:///d:/git/dezai/Dezai-Prototype/docs/IMPLEMENTED.md)

### Notes

- **No schema changes** — All Prisma models (`QuestionBank`, `QuestionBankQuestion`, `QuestionOption`, `Assessment`, `AssessmentAttempt`, `AttemptAnswer`, `ViolationLog`) were pre-defined in the locked schema. Zero migrations required.

- **Program/Track/Module bindings for Question Banks** — The Sprint 3 allocation lists "Program/Track/Module bindings" under Question Bank Management. The current implementation scopes Question Banks by `institutionId` (which is how the Prisma schema defines them). Since Programs belong to Institutions, filtering by `?institutionId` effectively scopes to the correct program set. Assessments themselves are bound to Modules via the `Assessment.moduleId` foreign key. No dedicated binding table or schema change was required.

- **AuditAction enum** — All write operations log using the existing `ASSESSMENT_PUBLISHED` enum value with descriptive `details` strings to differentiate actions (e.g. `"QuestionBank created: ..."`, `"Question deleted: ..."`), since the Prisma enum is locked.

- **No banned terms** — Verified zero occurrences of `exam`, `course`, `chapter`, `certificate` in the assessments module.

## [Sprint 6] — 2026-06-23

**Developer:** Krish Parmar 

### Analytics Completion

#### Added

- **Faculty Analytics Dashboard Enhancements** — Integrated `ModuleCompletionChart` and `ProgramPerformanceChart` directly into the existing `FacultyDashboard.tsx` "Analytics" tab, pulling data from existing endpoints without backend modification.
- **Program Performance & Assessment Analytics UI** — Implemented Recharts-based horizontal bar charts for module success rates and comparative grouped bar charts for student XP vs. progress metrics.
- **XP Growth & Achievement Analytics** — Created `XpGrowthChart` (an area chart mapping a student's XP level journey from 1 to 10) and injected it into the `AchievementsPage.tsx`.
- **Leaderboard Movement Analytics** — Added a dynamic rank movement delta (↑/↓) to the `StudentRankingCard` on the student dashboard, comparing all-time vs weekly leaderboard queries.
- **Institution Analytics Widgets** — Created a dedicated `InstitutionDashboardPage.tsx` using existing `leaderboards/universities` data to show global institution rank, active students, total XP, and program counts for university administrators.
- **Analytics Service & Types** — Centralized `analyticsService` wrapping `apiClient` and added complete TypeScript definitions for analytics payload shapes.

#### Changed

- **No Backend Changes Required** — All Sprint 6 requirements were successfully delivered as a frontend-only implementation, utilizing pre-existing endpoints.
- **StudentDashboardPage** — Updated to fetch the student widget on mount and pass the weekly rank prop down.

  - File: [frontend/src/features/leaderboards/components/student-ranking-card.tsx](file:///d:/Dezai-Prototype-main/frontend/src/features/leaderboards/components/student-ranking-card.tsx)

- **`TopPerformerList` Component** — Student-facing leaderboard list showing top 10 globally ranked students. Monthly / All-Time tab switcher. Rank badge, student name, institution, XP per row. Highlights the current user with a `You` badge. Includes loading skeleton, empty state, and error/retry.
  - File: [frontend/src/features/leaderboards/components/top-performer-list.tsx](file:///d:/Dezai-Prototype-main/frontend/src/features/leaderboards/components/top-performer-list.tsx)
  - Endpoint: `GET /api/leaderboards/students` (existing Sprint 4 endpoint — no backend changes)

### Changed

- **Student Dashboard** — Both components integrated into the right sidebar of `StudentDashboardPage`. Ranking card placed above the activity feed; performer list placed below it.
  - File: [frontend/src/features/learning/pages/StudentDashboardPage.tsx](file:///d:/Dezai-Prototype-main/frontend/src/features/learning/pages/StudentDashboardPage.tsx)

- **IMPLEMENTED.md** — Added Section 12 documenting Sprint 5 leaderboard frontend components.

### Notes

- No backend changes. All 5 leaderboard API endpoints were production-complete from Sprint 4.
- No Prisma schema changes, no new routes, no new pages.
